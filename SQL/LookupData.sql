In such a situation, the scene editing results from the character gaining insight from the dream. \r\nPortentS are prophetic dreams, powerful visions of what is to come—or of what is happening now. The dreams are filled with symbolic meaning, images, and metaphors. The meaning behind the dreams is not always obvious, but once you have experienced one, you will see the fulfillment of your visions in the unfolding of the events around you. \r\nYou may also choose the nature of a portent. By spending a point of Destiny, you may choose the symbolism and meaning of a portent dream, granting you a +1D that may be used toward making that dream come true.

Otherwise, such dreams are assumed to be premonitions. \r\nThe legends of the children of the forest speak of their greenseers, mighty wizards who wielded strange and elemental powers. Prophets, shamans, masters of the wild places—the stories of their mystical prowess have grown in the retelling, while other of their abilities have been lost to the march of years. \r\nWhile Green Dreams is the beginning of their powers, it is far from the pinnacle.
